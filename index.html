      <h3>Problems Faced in Goa</h3>
      <p>Goa is under threat. Coastal erosion, deforestation, plastic waste, and urban flooding are damaging our natural beauty and harming livelihoods.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Coastal Erosion</strong>: Morjim, Benaulim, and Palolem beaches are shrinking year by year.</li>
        <li><strong>Deforestation</strong>: Sensitive areas like Mollem face forest loss from unchecked development.</li>
        <li><strong>Plastic Waste</strong>: Unmanaged garbage is polluting our rivers, forests, and sea.</li>
        <li><strong>Urban Flooding</strong>: Poor planning and clogged drains flood cities like Panaji and Mapusa.</li>
      </ul>

            <p>Eco-friendly tourism is all about enjoying the natural beauty of Goa while minimizing your environmental impact.

            wildlife sanctuaries, and hidden beaches without disturbing local ecosystems — every choice matters. Join guided eco-tours led by local experts, 
            support businesses that follow zero-waste practices, and experience Goa in a way that’s responsible, enriching, and respectful to both people and planet.

          <h4>Actionable Tips</h4>
          <img src="ideas.jpg" alt="tips">
            <p>Taking climate-friendly action doesn’t have to be complicated — even the smallest steps can lead to meaningful change. 
                Say no to single-use plastics by carrying your own reusable bottles, bags, and straws. Support local farmers, artists, and small businesses instead of big chains to boost the local economy sustainably. 
                Participate in beach cleanups or tree-planting drives happening in your area or during your visit. Conserve water and energy wherever you stay, and choose public transport, bicycles, or shared rides when possible. 
                These everyday actions, when adopted collectively, help protect Goa’s environment and strengthen community resilience.</p>

          <h4>Empowering Youth</h4>
          <img src="youth.jpg" alt="Empowering youth">
            <p>Goa’s young changemakers are at the heart of the climate movement — leading the way with passion, innovation, 
                and a sense of responsibility for the future. From organizing tree plantation drives and waste segregation campaigns to 
                creating awareness through art, social media, and street plays, students and youth-led groups are making a real impact 
                in their communities. Through workshops, school projects, and local partnerships, we aim to highlight and support these efforts, 
                encouraging more young minds to take climate action and become ambassadors of sustainability. When youth rise, the future thrives.</p>
