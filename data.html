      <h2> Goa’s Climate Crisis: Key Challenges</h2>
        <p>Climate change is no longer a distant threat 
            it’s already reshaping Goa’s landscape and way of life. Rising sea levels are causing severe coastal erosion, 
            with several beaches shrinking year after year. Frequent and unpredictable monsoons are impacting agriculture, while increasing temperatures 
            threaten biodiversity in our forests and wildlife sanctuaries. Plastic pollution continues to choke our rivers and marine life, despite growing awareness. 
            Here, we present real data, visual maps, and case studies that reveal the scale of these issues — helping you understand not just what’s happening, but why it matters. 
            Awareness backed by evidence is the first step toward action.

          <h3> Coastal Erosion</h3>
          <img src="costal.jpg" alt="erosion">
          <p>According to the National Centre for Coastal Research (NCCR), <strong>more than 40% of Goa's shoreline is eroding</strong>. Popular beaches like Morjim, Palolem, 
            and Benaulim are witnessing significant sand loss each year due to rising sea levels, unplanned construction, and frequent storms. 
            This not only threatens tourism but also affects coastal communities and ecosystems that depend on stable shorelines for their livelihood and safety.

          <h3> Deforestation in Mollem</h3>
          <img src="trees.jpg" alt="deforestation">
          <p>In 2020, over <strong>170 hectares</strong> of protected forest land in Mollem came under threat from large-scale infrastructure projects, 
            including railways, highways, and power lines. This biodiverse region, part of the Western Ghats, is home to hundreds of rare and endemic plant and animal species. 
            Environmentalists and citizens raised strong objections, highlighting the long-term ecological damage such developments could cause.

        <div class="data-box">
          <h3> Plastic Pollution</h3>
          <img src="plastic.jpg" alt="plastic">
          <p>Goa generates over <strong>200 tons of solid waste daily</strong>, a large share of which is plastic. Despite growing awareness, improper disposal and 
            limited recycling infrastructure mean that much of this waste ends up in rivers and the Arabian Sea. Marine life — including turtles, fish, and coastal birds
             — often mistake plastic for food, to injury or death and disrupting the delicate coastal ecosystem.

        <div class="data-box">
          <h3> Urban Flooding</h3>
          <img src="urban.jpg" alt="flooding">
          <p>Panaji and Mapusa experience severe flooding each monsoon season, largely due to <strong>clogged drainage systems and the rapid loss of natural wetlands</strong> 
            that once absorbed excess rainwater. As urban areas expand without adequate planning, water has nowhere to go — leading to waterlogging, property damage, and major disruptions. 
            Every year, thousands of homes, shops, and local livelihoods are affected, highlighting the urgent need for sustainable urban development and better waste management.
          </p>

        <div class="data-box">
          <h3> Tourism at Risk</h3>
          <img src="tourists.jpg" alt="tourism">
          <p>Tourism contributes over <strong>16% to Goa’s GDP</strong>, supporting thousands of local jobs in hospitality, transport, and small businesses. 
            However, as beaches erode, garbage accumulates, and natural beauty declines, tourist satisfaction and footfall begin to drop. 
            This not only affects the state’s economy but also threatens the livelihoods of communities that depend heavily on sustainable tourism for income and growth.
